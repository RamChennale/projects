Serialization:

A process where you convert an Instance of a Class (Object of a class) into a Byte Stream. 
This Byte Stream can then be stored as a file on the disk or can also be sent to another 
computer via the network. 
Serialization can also be used to save the sate of Object when the program shuts down or hibernates. 
Once the state is saved on disk using Serialization.
We can restore the state by DeSerializing the class from disk.

Serializable Interface

1. java.io.Serializable - It is a marker interface, it does not have any method to implement.
2. java.io.Externalizable - but have to implement these two methods
	2.1 readExternal(ObjectInput input)
	2.2 writeExternal(ObjectOutput output)
	

Deserialization:
