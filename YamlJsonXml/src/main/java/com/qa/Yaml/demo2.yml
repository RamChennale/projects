#There’s another small quirk to YAML. All YAML files (regardless of their association with
# Ansible or not) can optionally begin with --- and end with .... This is part of the YAML
# format and indicates the start and end of a document.
#All members of a list are lines beginning at the same indentation level starting with a
# "- " (a dash and a space):

---
# A list of tasty fruits
- Apple
- Orange
- Strawberry
- Mango
    
    
#    A dictionary is represented in a simple key: value form 
#(the colon must be followed by a space):
# An employee record
